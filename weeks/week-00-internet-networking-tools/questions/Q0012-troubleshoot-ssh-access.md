## Question
How do you troubleshoot when you canâ€™t SSH into a server?

## Short Answer
Check the basics first â€” **network reachability, credentials, and SSH configuration**.  
Most SSH issues come from:
1. Wrong key or username  
2. Security group or firewall blocking port 22  
3. Server SSH service not running  
4. Network path issues or misconfigured routing/NAT

## Deep Dive

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Network Reachability
- **Ping** the server:  
  ```bash
  ping <server-ip>
If no response, the server may be down or blocked by a firewall.

Check SSH port (22) using telnet or nc:

bash
Copy code
nc -zv <server-ip> 22
ðŸ”¹ 2. Security Groups & Firewalls
On AWS: confirm your Security Group allows inbound traffic on port 22 from your IP.

On Azure: verify the Network Security Group (NSG) rules permit port 22.

Locally, check if any firewall (e.g., Windows Defender or ufw) blocks SSH.

ðŸ”¹ 3. SSH Key or Authentication
Ensure youâ€™re using the right private key:

```bash

ssh -i <my-key.pem> ubuntu@<server-ip>

```
Confirm correct user (e.g., ubuntu, ec2-user, centos).

Check permissions:

```bash

chmod 400 <my-key.pem>

```

## Pitfalls
- Using a .pem key with incorrect permissions (should be 400)
- Forgetting to open port 22 in your security group
- Copying keys with line breaks or spaces
- Trying to log in with the wrong user for your OS
