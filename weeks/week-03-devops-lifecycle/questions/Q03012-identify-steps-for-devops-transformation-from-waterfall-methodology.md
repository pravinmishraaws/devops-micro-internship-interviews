## Question
 Identify the first three steps to start a DevOps transformation from the waterfall methodology.

## Short Answer
- Assess Current Processes: Evaluate existing workflows, tools, and team structures to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

- Foster a DevOps Culture: Promote collaboration between development and operations teams, emphasizing shared responsibility and continuous learning.

- Automate the Pipeline: Start automating build, test, and deployment processes to enable faster and more reliable software delivery.

## Deep Dive
- 1. Assess Current Processes and Pain Points
Before making any changes, you need a clear understanding of where you stand.
• 	Map your existing workflows: Identify how code moves from development to production.
• 	Spot bottlenecks: Look for delays in testing, deployment, or feedback loops.
• 	Evaluate tooling and team structure: Understand what tools are in use and how siloed your teams are.
This diagnostic phase helps you prioritize what needs to change and where DevOps can add the most value.

- 2. Foster a DevOps Culture and Mindset
DevOps is as much about people as it is about tools.
• 	Break down silos: Encourage collaboration between development, operations, QA, and security.
• 	Promote shared ownership: Everyone should be responsible for the success of the product — from coding to deployment.
• 	Invest in training: Educate teams on Agile, CI/CD, and DevOps principles. Workshops, certifications, and hands-on labs can accelerate adoption.
Culture change is often the hardest part, but it’s essential for long-term success.

- 3. Introduce Automation and Agile Practices
Start small and scale gradually.
• 	Automate repetitive tasks: Begin with CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure provisioning.
• 	Pilot Agile workflows: Use Scrum or Kanban on a small project to test iterative delivery and fast feedback.
• 	Use modern tools: Adopt platforms like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Kubernetes to support automation and scalability.
Automation reduces human error and speeds up delivery, while Agile practices help teams adapt quickly to changing requirements.


## Pitfalls / Gotchas
- 1. Cultural Resistance and Siloed Mindsets
- 2. Tooling Chaos or Poor Integration
- 3. Underestimating Complexity of Change
- 4. Delayed Feedback and Testing
- 5. Rigid Requirements and Planning
- 6. Lack of Executive Support
- 7. Security Oversights
