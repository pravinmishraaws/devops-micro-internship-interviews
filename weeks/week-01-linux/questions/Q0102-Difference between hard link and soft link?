Question

Differentiate between a hard link and a soft (symbolic) link in Linux.

Short Answer

Hard link: Points directly to inode.

Soft link: Points to a file path.

Hard links can’t span filesystems or link to directories.

Deep Dive

Hard link shares the same inode; deleting the original doesn’t remove data until all links are deleted.

Soft link breaks if the target file is removed.

Pitfalls

Using hard links across partitions fails.
