## Question
List and explain the key phases of the DevOps life cycle. Provide one example tool used in each phase.

## Short Answer
The DevOps life cycle includes planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring.  
Each phase uses tools such as Jira (plan), Git (code), Jenkins (build), Selenium (test), Docker (deploy), and Prometheus (monitor).

## Deep Dive
- **Plan:** Define goals and requirements using tools like Jira or Trello.  
- **Code:** Developers write and manage code in repositories such as Git.  
- **Build:** Code is compiled and packaged using tools like Jenkins or Maven.  
- **Test:** Automated testing tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit) ensure quality.  
- **Release & Deploy:** Docker or Kubernetes automate deployment to environments.  
- **Operate & Monitor:** Tools like Prometheus and Grafana track performance and issues.
