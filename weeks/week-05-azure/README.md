**Focus:** Brief overview for this week.

## Recent Updates

Added Q0513-Q0516 covering EpicBook's migration to Azure cloud services. These questions walk through real-world scenarios of moving a single-server app to a modern cloud platform. Topics include:

- Setting up clustered servers for better reliability and easier updates
- Using canary deployments to safely test new features with real users
- Securing communication between different parts of the application
- Handling sudden traffic spikes with automatic scaling

Each question includes practical examples and common pitfalls to watch out for. They're based on typical challenges you'll face when moving apps to the cloud.
