## Question
How important Linux optimization for DevOps?

## Short Answer
- Performance efficiency: Optimizing CPU usage, memory consumption, Disk I/O, Network Throughput
- Realibility and uptime: Stability preventing system crash 
- Speeds means lower cost: Optimizing means savings

## Deep Dive
- `top`(System Performance), `netstat`(Networking), `systemd`(Process Management), `ext4`(Storage) 

## Pitfalls
- Optimizing without measure. Doesn't mean fast it is stable

## References
- man `top`, `systemd`, `netstat`, `ext4`
