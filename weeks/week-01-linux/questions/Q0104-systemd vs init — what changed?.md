## Question
Compare init and systemd. How does systemd improve service management?

## Short Answer
- systemd is parallel, event-driven, dependency-aware.
- Replaces SysV init’s linear startup scripts.

## Deep Dive
- Uses unit files (.service, .target) instead of rc scripts.
- Faster boot; unified logging via journald.

## Pitfalls
- Misconfigured dependencies (After, Requires) cause boot issues.


## References
- systemctl, journalctl
