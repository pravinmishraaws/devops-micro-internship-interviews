## Question
Our security team just did an audit of EpicBook, and they're worried about how our different application layers talk to each other. Right now we've got our web frontend, application logic, and database all running in Azure, but they want to make sure we're following best practices for keeping communication between these layers secure. What's the right way to set this up? How do we make sure no unauthorized access can happen between these different parts of our system?

## Short Answer
Think of our three-tier setup like a secure building. The web layer is like the lobby - it's where visitors come in. The app layer is like the office floors - only authorized people can access it. The database is like the vault - super restricted access. We use Azure's security tools to create these separate zones and control who can go where. Everything's encrypted, and most communication happens on private networks, not the public internet.

## Deep Dive
In practice, we set this up by creating separate "neighborhoods" (subnets) in Azure for each part of our app. The web servers live in one subnet, application servers in another, and databases in a third. It's like having security checkpoints between these areas - we use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to create strict rules about who can talk to whom.

We also use Azure's Application Gateway as our main entrance - it's like having a really smart security guard who checks everyone's ID, inspects packages (requests), and makes sure nobody's trying anything suspicious. For sensitive stuff like passwords and API keys, we keep them in Azure Key Vault - think of it as our digital safe deposit box. The cool part is that our app components can talk to each other directly within Azure's network, without their traffic ever touching the public internet.

## Pitfalls
- Allowing wide open NSG rules exposes the system to attacks.  
- Using public IPs for database or app tiers is unsafe.  
- Ignoring encryption between layers risks data leaks.  
- Not using service endpoints causes unnecessary internet routing.
