## Question
Compare the difference in structure and benefits between IPv4 and IPv6. Give examples of IPv6 usage.

## Short Answer
- IPv4: 32-bit addresses, ~4.3 billion unique addresses; IPv6: 128-bit addresses, practically unlimited.  
- IPv6 simplifies routing, supports auto-configuration, and improves security (IPSec).  
- IPv6 examples: modern websites, ISPs using dual-stack networks, and IoT devices.

## Deep Dive
- IPv6 header simplification reduces router processing.  
- IPv6 includes features like multicast, anycast, and better NAT avoidance.  
- Tools to check addresses: `ping6`, `traceroute6`, `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`.

## Pitfalls
- Mixing IPv4 and IPv6 without proper dual-stack setup can cause connectivity issues.  
- Legacy systems may not fully support IPv6.
