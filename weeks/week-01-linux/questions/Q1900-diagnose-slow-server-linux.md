## Question
A server is running slowly. Walk me through your systematic approach to diagnose the issue using Linux commands.

## Short Answer
- Start with `top` or `htop` to check CPU and memory usage, identifying which processes are consuming the most resources.
- Run `iostat -x 1` to see if disk I/O is the bottleneck, looking for high %util values or long await times.
- Check system logs with `dmesg | tail` and `journalctl -xe` for errors, verify disk space with `df -h`, and confirm swap usage isn't excessive using `free -h`.

## Deep Dive

**Initial Resource Assessment:**

When a server runs slowly, start with a top-down approach. The `top` or `htop` commands provide real-time views of CPU usage, memory consumption, and running processes. Look for processes with high %CPU or %MEM values—these are your primary suspects.

**Disk I/O Investigation:**

Disk bottlenecks are common culprits for slow performance. Use `iostat -x 1` to monitor disk statistics every second. Key metrics include:
- `%util`: Percentage of time the disk was busy (>80% indicates saturation)
- `await`: Average wait time for I/O requests (high values mean slow disk)
- `r/s` and `w/s`: Read and write operations per second

For more detailed process-level I/O analysis, use `iotop` to see which processes are generating disk activity.

**Network and Connection Analysis:**

Check for network-related slowness with `netstat -tulpn` or the more modern `ss -tulpn` to view active connections. Use `ss -s` for summary statistics. If you see an unusual number of connections in TIME_WAIT or ESTABLISHED states, you might have a networking issue or application problem.

**System Logs and Health:**

Review system logs for hardware errors, kernel issues, or service failures:
- `dmesg | tail`: Recent kernel messages (hardware errors, driver issues)
- `journalctl -xe`: Systemd service logs with recent errors
- `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`: General system logs

**Additional Diagnostics:**

- `vmstat 1`: Virtual memory statistics, showing CPU, memory, and I/O stats
- `free -h`: Memory usage including swap (high swap usage indicates memory pressure)
- `df -h`: Disk space usage (full disks cause major performance issues)
- `uptime`: Shows load average and how long the system has been running

## Pitfalls / Gotchas

- **Snapshot vs. Trend**: Running commands once gives you a snapshot; for intermittent issues, use monitoring tools or run commands in a loop to catch patterns over time.
- **Ignoring Load Average Context**: A load of 5.0 means different things on a 2-core vs. 16-core system—always compare load to available CPU cores.
- **Overlooking Swap Thrashing**: If swap usage is high and constantly changing, the system is thrashing (swapping pages in/out rapidly), which severely degrades performance—add more RAM or reduce memory usage.
- **Missing the Obvious**: Always check `df -h` first—a full disk (especially root partition) causes cascading failures and slow performance across the entire system.
